Dev Version of osu! Skin Creator

osu! Skin Creator if a suppot software for the game osu!. 

With this you can easy create own costum skins without browsing hundrets 
of directories in your windows. OSC searching osu skin files on your local 
installation of osu! and give you the possibility to create costum skins only by 
clicking the required graphics and souns in the software.

Its currently in progress, so dont use it for real - its senseless.

To make the engine running, search in the web for the software "RPG Maker XP" and 
install the "RGSS Player". You do not need the game dev engine byself. Only the player.

The base script in the project is loading and evaluating, then running the 
scripts "Lib/Load.rb" and "Lib/Run.rb". This script are doing all the rest ;)
